# ListApp

![Alt text](listapp-512x512.png =125x125)

Simple HTML app for saving lists of activities. Very basic but extremely helpful. Save a grocery list or a daily list of things to do into your phone or laptop and review it at any time. Lists are saved by date and time to allow for least amount of input action by you.

You must synch your devices to see lists between devices since this app only uses localStorage as a method to save all work. You can add more than lists. The text you enter can be pasted from your device or you can even enter full paragraphs of a stroy idea.

Have fun. Now warranties or liability for use.
